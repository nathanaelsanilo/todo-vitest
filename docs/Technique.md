# Technique

## Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm

Pointer Algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds.

1. This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list
2. One pointer will moving twice as fast as the other one

## Sliding Window

## Two Pointer

Two pointer technique is commonly used to solve array

1. typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array
2. one pointer slow-runner and the other fast-runner
3. the input array should be sorted before using two pointer technique

Example: [see here](../src/utils/TwoPointer.ts)
